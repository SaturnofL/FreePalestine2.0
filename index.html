        <p> Welcome to Free Palestine. Here we provide you with information on the ongoing issue in the middle east between the people of Palestine and the people of Israel. Feel free to navigate over to our ‘History of Palestine’ section to read about the history and how everything led up to the current timeline.</p>

        <h2>Palestine in 2023</h2>
        <p>Palestine in the current year of 2023 is in the worst state its ever been in since the conflict began back in 1947. Since then, for 75 years, Israel has been continously pushing Palestinians out of their homes and land and violating every human right that a human could possibly have. Just in the past 15 days, thousands of lives have been lost due to the constant bombing that Israel has been doing to Palestinians trapped in Gaza. The casualities that were officially posted by the UN from 2008 to 2020 show that Palestinians have always been fighting a losing battle whilst Israel continues to be more aggressive with every attack.
            <img src="images/stats.JPG">
        To make matters worse, the UN itself cannot pass a ceasefire due to powers like the United States and the UK voting against it. So Palestinians have no real support to truly help them even though people across the world support them.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to reach as many people as we possibly can because though those in power will not support Palestine, ultimately the people can make a change within those same countries if enough push back against them. So please, lend your support to the Palestinians and those who support them.</p>

        <h2> Our goal</h2>
        <p>Free Palestine’s mission is to bring awareness to the Palestine vs Israel events that are currently going on in the world. We wish to inform the uninformed and create funding for the people of Palestine, because we’re all for helping those who are oppressed be free.</p></section>
