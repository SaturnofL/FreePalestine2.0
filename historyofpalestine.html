    <h1>History of Palestine</h1>
    
    <section>
    <h2> Late 1900s until now.</h2>
    <p> The conflict between Palestine and Israel began back in the 1940s when Israel first began to form. Great Britain pulled out of Palestine and the United Nations decided to divide the land into Arab and Jewish states. Palestinians were against this happening because their land was being taken from them and despite making up a less percentage of the population, Jewish people were given a bigger portion of the land. So the newly formed State of Israel had more land than the other two territories; The West Bank and the Gaza Strip. War broke out during these times and 750,000 Palestinians ended up displaced afterwards.</p>
    <p>Over the following years, more conflicts arose between Israel and other countries. Egypt, Syria, and Jordan also went against Israel when Israel, Great Britain, and France decided to launch a united attack against Egypt hoping to instill a regime change and place a new leader at the head. This attack failed but that made Egypt ally with Jordan and Syria which led to the Six-Day War. However, Israel ended up gaining more territory after that war ended and later more attacks between each side continued before they signed a peace treaty known as the Camp David Accords.</p>
    <p>The Camp David Accords hoped to create some sort of peace for all parties but that only lasted so long. Due to more continous conflict between Palestinians and Israel, multiple new accords were created to soothe the tension, but those were only temporary measures and eventually they failed as well. Palestinians achieved some sort of independence and were able to self govern themselves but they still grieved over land that was wrongfully taken from them over the many decades. With conflict sparking up again between Israel and Palestine, this led to a wall being built around Gaza; trapping civillians who live there, despite international forces opposing the action. Hamas eventually was created and once they won an election over another organization known as Fatah, they eventually formed an united front with Fatah in 2014 and have led a continous resistance against Israel ever since.</p></section>
